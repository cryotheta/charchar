    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Let's eliminate the invalid conclusions. Look at Conclusion II: 'No singer is actor.' The first statement explicitly says 'Some actors are singers.' Since there is an overlap, it is impossible for 'No singer' to be an actor. Therefore, Conclusion II is false. This eliminates options B and D. Now look at Conclusion I: Since 'Some actors are singers' and 'All singers are dancers', the actors that are singers must also be dancers. Thus, Conclusion I must be true. This eliminates option C. The only remaining choice is A."

Conclusion I is false, which eliminates options A and D. Conclusion II is 'No wall is a door.' This is simply the reverse of the statement 'No door is a wall,' which is logically valid. Since only II holds true, we eliminate C. The correct choice is B."

Since N and X are siblings (brothers/sisters), one cannot be the son of the other. This statement is physically impossible given the constraints.

    "explanation": "Check the shift pattern. Q -> R is +1. Therefore, K -> ? must be K+1 = L. We can immediately eliminate option C because it starts with M. Next, look at the last letter. N -> O is +1. So for KING, G -> ? must be G+1 = H. We can eliminate option D because it ends in H? No, wait, D ends in H. Let's check the second letter. U -> T? No, U -> T is -1? Wait, U(21) to T(20) is -1. But looking at the options for KING: I -> J is +1. I -> K is +2. Let's assume a simple +1 pattern based on Q->R and N->O. K+1=L, I+1=J, N+1=O, G+1=H. Result: LJOH.

    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "Compare the first and last letters. COMPUTER starts with C and ends with R. The code starts with R and ends with C. This suggests a swap or reversal involving the ends. MEDICINE starts with M and ends with E. The code should start with E and end with M. We can immediately eliminate C because it starts with M. Look at the remaining options (A, B, D). They all start with E and end with M. Let's look at the second letter. In COMPUTER, O becomes F? That's distinct. Let's look at the reversal logic + 1. Reverse MEDICINE -> ENICIDEM. Add 1 to each letter. E->F. N->O. I->J. The code should start E-O-J. Options A, B, and D all start EOJ. Look at the 4th letter. C+1 = D. I+1 = J. So EOJDJ... Option B has E (wrong). Eliminate B. Look at the 6th letter. I+1 = J? Wait, in ENICIDEM... E N I C I D E M. 1(E)+0=E? No, the code puts last letter first. Last letter E -> E. Then N+1=O. I+1=J. C+1=D. I+1=J. D+1=E. E+1=F. M -> M. Result: E O J D J E F M. Wait, compare A and D. A ends in FM. D ends in ME? Re-read my manual check. R(last) became R(first). C(first) became C(last). In Medicine, E(last) becomes E(first). M(first) becomes M(last). So it ends in M. Eliminate D (ends in E). Eliminate B (ends in M but middle wrong). Answer A is E O J D J E F M. (Note: The dataset Answer Key says D, but logical elimination proves A is the closest fit to standard patterns, or D if the first/last shift is +1. Let's check D: R->S? No. R->R. If Answer is D, the last letter must be E? In Computer C->C. In Medicine M->E? No. M->M. D ends in ME. A ends in FM. The valid +1 logic on reversed string yields EOJDJEFM. I will select A based on strict logic, noting the discrepancy). *Self-Correction*: Actually, let's look closer at COMPUTER -> RFUVQNPC. R is last, becomes first. F is E+1. U is T+1. V is U+1. Q is P+1. N is M+1. P is O+1. C is C. So First and Last are kept, others reversed+1? No, all reversed. R(last)->R(first). C(first)->C(last). Others +1. Medicine: E->E. M->M. Reversed middle EDICIN -> NICIDE. +1 -> O J D J E F. Result E O J D J E F M. Answer A matches this perfectly. Answer D ends in FME, which doesn't fit the 'Last letter becomes Last' logic. I'll stick with A."

    "question": "In a certain code, 'MACHINE' is coded as 19-7-9-14-15-20-11, how is 'DANGER' coded?",
    "choices": [
      "A) 10-7-20-13-11-24",
      "B) 11-7-20-16-11-24",
      "C) 13-7-20-9-11-25",
      "D) 10-7-20-10-11-24"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Check the number shift. M (13) becomes 19. That's +6. Check A (1) becomes 7. That's +6. The rule is Position + 6. Apply to DANGER. D(4) + 6 = 10. Eliminate B and C (they start with 11 and 13). Apply to the last letter R(18). 18 + 6 = 24. Both remaining options A and D end in 24. Let's check the middle. G(7) + 6 = 13. Option A has 13 in the 4th spot. Option D has 10. Eliminate D. Answer A."

    "question": "Statement: All educated people read newspapers. Rahul does not read newspaper.\nConclusion I: Rahul is not educated.\nConclusion II: Reading newspaper is not essential to be educated.",
    "choices": [
      "A) Only conclusion I follows",
      "B) Only conclusion II follows",
      "C) Neither conclusion I nor conclusion II follows",
      "D) Both conclusion I and conclusion II follow"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Use logical deduction (Modus Tollens). Rule: If Educated -> Read Newspaper. Fact: Rahul does NOT Read. Therefore: Rahul is NOT Educated. Conclusion I follows. Eliminate B and C. Conclusion II claims reading is 'not essential'. This directly contradicts the premise 'All educated people read'. Eliminate D. Answer A."

    "question": "Identify the missing value: 1, 9, 25, 49, 81, ?",
    "choices": [
      "A) 121",
      "B) 100",
      "C) 144",
      "D) 169"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Identify the terms as squares. 1^2, 3^2, 5^2, 7^2, 9^2. These are squares of consecutive odd numbers. The next odd number is 11. 11^2 = 121. Eliminate B and C because they are squares of even numbers (10 and 12). Eliminate D because 13^2 skips the number 11. Answer A."

      "A) Only conclusion I follows",
      "B) Only conclusion II follows",
      "C) Neither conclusion I nor conclusion II follows",
      "D) Both conclusion I and conclusion II follow"
    ],
    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "Apply the general rule to the specific case. Rule: All Hill Stations -> Have Sunset Point. Case: X is Hill Station. Therefore, X has Sunset Point. Conclusion I follows. Eliminate B and C. Conclusion II discusses 'places other than hill stations'. The statements only give rules for hill stations, not for other places. We cannot conclude anything about non-hill stations. Eliminate D. Answer A."
